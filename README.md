### What is Sum Of All Fears?

Sum of all fears challenge is intended to assess a candidateâ€™s ability to work with Arrays. This challenge or a slight variation has been used by technology companies such as Amazon and Google and was also featured as a Daily Coding Problem in dev.to.

### For example
Given a list of numbers and a number K, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to K.

Example: given [10, 15, 3, 7] and K of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.

The basic challenge is to write a program that uses a hard-coded array of [10, 15, 3, 7] and allows the user to enter a value for K before running the algorithm and returning true or false.
